    tags: ["ielts", "writing task 1", "band 8", "academic writing", "high score"],
    content: `Achieving a band 8 in IELTS Writing Task 1 requires a sophisticated and accurate response that fully addresses all aspects of the visual data. Your report must demonstrate a high level of proficiency across all four marking criteria. For Task Achievement, you need to present a clear and comprehensive overview that highlights all the key features and trends. Following the overview, your body paragraphs must support these key points with accurately selected data from the graphic.
To score high in Coherence and Cohesion, your answer must be logically organized with clear paragraphing, making it easy for the examiner to follow your points.[1] You should use a variety of linking words and phrases naturally and effectively. For Lexical Resource, you need to demonstrate a wide range of vocabulary appropriate for describing data, trends, and processes. This includes using less common words and phrases with precision.
Finally, a band 8 requires a high degree of control over Grammatical Range and Accuracy. You must use a wide variety of complex sentence structures with very few errors.[1] This means your control over grammar and punctuation should be near-perfect. Remember to write in a formal, academic style and manage your time effectively, dedicating about 20 minutes to this task.[2]`

    content: `To effectively describe a line graph in IELTS Writing Task 1, start by analyzing the axes to understand what is being measured and over what period.[1][2] Your response should be structured into four clear paragraphs.[3]
First, write an introduction by paraphrasing the information provided in the question.[3][4][5] Next, write a concise overview paragraph that summarizes the main trends, such as the overall upward or downward movements, without citing specific data.[2][5] This overview is a crucial part of your report.[4]
The following two body paragraphs should describe the trends in detail.[6] Group information logically, for instance, by describing lines with similar patterns together.[4][6] It is essential to support your descriptions with specific figures and dates from the graph.[4] Use a variety of vocabulary to describe change, including verbs (increased, fluctuated), adverbs (sharply, steadily), nouns (a rapid rise), and adjectives (a significant decrease).[1][7][8] Finally, always proofread your work for accuracy and clarity.`

    content: `To achieve a high band score in IELTS Writing Task 1, you must use a wide and precise range of vocabulary to describe the data presented. This involves moving beyond common words and using less common lexical items accurately.[1] For describing trends, instead of just "increase" or "decrease," use more descriptive verbs and nouns.
For upward trends, use verbs like surge, rocket, climb, or grow, and nouns like a surge, a growth, or an increase.[2][3][4] For downward trends, employ verbs such as plummet, plunge, drop, or decline, and nouns like a plunge, a fall, or a decrease.[2][3][4] To describe the speed of change, use adverbs like dramatically, sharply, considerably, or significantly for major changes, and steadily, gradually, or slightly for more moderate movements.[2][3][5]
When data remains stable, use phrases like remained steady, stayed constant, remained stable, or reached a plateau.[2][5][6] Using this varied and precise vocabulary demonstrates a sophisticated command of English, which is essential for scoring a band 7 or higher.[7] Avoid repetition and ensure the words you choose fit the specific context of the graph or chart.[8]`

    content: `To achieve a high score for Coherence and Cohesion in IELTS Writing Task 1, your response must be logically organized and easy to follow.[1][2][3] This criterion assesses how well you structure your ideas and connect them. Proper paragraphing is fundamental; you should structure your report with an introduction and two body paragraphs, with each paragraph focusing on a central idea or a logical grouping of information from the visual data.[4][5]
Cohesion involves using linking words and phrases to create a smooth flow between sentences and paragraphs.[2][3] Use a variety of cohesive devices to show relationships between ideas, such as "In contrast," to highlight differences, or "Similarly," for comparisons. However, avoid overusing these words or using them incorrectly, as this can confuse the reader.[6][7]
Another key aspect is referencing, which means using pronouns (e.g., "it," "they") and synonyms to avoid repeating the same nouns.[6][8] This technique makes your writing less repetitive and more sophisticated.[6] By skillfully combining clear paragraphing, a range of appropriate linking devices, and effective referencing, you will demonstrate strong Coherence and Cohesion.[8]`

Simply using complex words is not enough; you must use them correctly and in the right context.
Key strategies include paraphrasing the prompt effectively and avoiding the repetition of the same words and phrases.[1][2] For example, instead of repeatedly using "increase," you can use synonyms like "a rise," "a growth," or verbs such as "to climb" or "to surge".[1] It is also important to use less common lexical items and collocations (words that naturally go together, like "a significant increase") correctly to make your writing sound more natural and sophisticated.[3][4]
Accuracy is crucial. This includes correct spelling and word formation. It's better to use a word you know is correct than to use a more complex word incorrectly.[1] Developing your vocabulary by reading widely and keeping a vocabulary journal can significantly help in building the lexical range needed for a high score.[5]`

    content: `To achieve a high score in Grammatical Range and Accuracy, you need to demonstrate both variety in your sentence structures and a high level of correctness. This criterion accounts for 25% of your score and requires you to use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences effectively.[1][2][3] Over-relying on simple sentences will limit your score, so it's crucial to incorporate more advanced structures.[1][4]
For 'Range', aim to use different grammatical forms. This includes comparative and superlative structures to contrast data, the passive voice (especially for process diagrams), and complex sentences that use subordinate clauses (e.g., clauses starting with 'while', 'although', or 'whereas').[1][5] Using a variety of sentence beginnings and structures makes your writing more dynamic and demonstrates your grammatical flexibility.[1] A common mistake is creating long, complicated sentences that are difficult to understand; a "complex" sentence is about grammatical structure, not length.[2][6]
For 'Accuracy', your writing must be largely free of errors.[7] Pay close attention to common mistakes such as subject-verb agreement, correct tense usage based on the chart's timeline, prepositions, and articles (a/an/the).[8][9] A high-scoring response will have very few errors in grammar and punctuation, ensuring that your meaning is always clear to the examiner.[1][8] Always leave time to proofread your work to correct any small mistakes.[10]`

For instance, if a question asks you to discuss both views and give your own opinion, you must dedicate space to all three of these components to satisfy the task requirements.[2]
Your position on the topic must be clear and consistent throughout the entire essay.[1][4] This position should be introduced in the introduction, developed in the body paragraphs, and summarized in the conclusion. Each main idea you present must be relevant to the question and well-supported with explanations, evidence, or specific examples from your own knowledge or experience.[1][5][6]
Avoid making overgeneralizations or presenting ideas that are not fully developed.[4] For a high score, your arguments need to be extended and well-supported, showing the examiner that you can explore the topic in depth.[4] Finally, ensure your essay is at least 250 words, as failing to meet the word count will result in a penalty.[1][3]`

    content: `To achieve a high score for Coherence and Cohesion in IELTS Writing Task 2, your essay must be logically structured and your ideas must be well-connected.[1][2][3] Coherence refers to the logical organization of your essay, which is achieved through effective paragraphing.[2][3][4] A standard structure includes an introduction, two to three body paragraphs, and a conclusion.[4][5] Each body paragraph should focus on a single main idea, introduced by a clear topic sentence, and then developed with supporting explanations and examples.[2][3][5]
Cohesion refers to the way your sentences and paragraphs are linked together.[2][3][4] This is achieved by using a range of cohesive devices, such as linking words (e.g., "however," "in addition") and pronouns (e.g., "it," "they") to connect ideas smoothly.[1][6] However, it is crucial to use these linking words appropriately and not overuse them, as this can make your writing sound unnatural and mechanical.[1][2][7]
Effective referencing, by using pronouns and synonyms to avoid repetition, also contributes to good cohesion.[1][6] Ultimately, the goal is to guide the reader through your argument in a clear and logical way, making your essay easy to follow and understand.[1][8] Planning your essay before you start writing is a key step to ensure both coherence and cohesion.[3]`

This criterion, which accounts for 25% of your marks, isn't about using as many "fancy" words as possible, but about choosing the right word for the context to convey your meaning clearly.[1][2][3] The examiner will assess your ability to use a variety of words, employ less common vocabulary naturally, and use collocations (words that frequently go together, like "heavy rain") correctly.[3]
A key strategy is to avoid repetition. Practice paraphrasing the question and your own ideas using synonyms and different sentence structures. However, be mindful that synonyms can have subtle differences in meaning.[3] Accuracy is paramount; frequent errors in word choice, spelling, or word formation will lower your score, even if the vocabulary is ambitious.[4][5] It is better to use a simpler word correctly than a complex one incorrectly.[1]
Focus on building your topic-specific vocabulary for common IELTS themes like the environment, technology, and education.[4][6] Reading widely from reputable sources such as newspapers and academic journals is an excellent way to expand your vocabulary and see how words are used in context.[6][7] Ultimately, a high score in Lexical Resource comes from a balance of range, accuracy, and the natural use of language to communicate your ideas effectively.[5]`

For Task 2, "Task Achievement" is replaced with "Task Response," but the other three criteria remain the same.[1][2][3][4]
Task Achievement/Response: This assesses how well you have answered the question. For Task 1, it's about accurately summarizing the visual data and highlighting key features. For Task 2, it's about addressing all parts of the prompt and developing a clear and consistent position.[1][4]
Coherence and Cohesion: This criterion evaluates the structure and logical flow of your writing. It looks at how you organize your ideas into paragraphs and how you connect sentences and ideas using linking words and phrases.[1][4]
Lexical Resource: This focuses on the range and accuracy of your vocabulary. A high score requires using a wide range of words, including less common items, with precision and correct spelling.[1][4]

It is officially recommended to spend approximately 20 minutes on Writing Task 1 and 40 minutes on Writing Task 2.[5][6] This allocation is strategic because Task 2 contributes twice as much to your final writing score as Task 1.[6]
A common strategy is to dedicate the first few minutes of each task to planning. For both tasks, spending 3-5 minutes creating a brief outline can help you organize your thoughts and structure your response logically, which can save you time later.[5][7] After writing, you should aim to leave 2-3 minutes at the end of each task to review your work.

    content: `Meeting the minimum word count in the IELTS Writing test is essential for achieving a good score. For Writing Task 1, you must write at least 150 words, and for Writing Task 2, the minimum is 250 words.[8][9] Failing to meet these minimums will result in a penalty to your score for Task Achievement (Task 1) or Task Response (Task 2).[8][10] This is because a response that is too short is considered underdeveloped and cannot sufficiently address the requirements of the task.[11][12]
While there is no official upper word limit, writing significantly more than the minimum is not recommended. Overly long responses can waste valuable time, increase the likelihood of grammatical errors, and may cause your writing to lose focus and go off-topic.[8][10] A good guideline is to aim for 160-180 words for Task 1 and 260-290 words for Task 2.[8][10][11] This ensures your response is well-developed without being unnecessarily long. Practicing with official answer sheets can help you visually estimate your word count without needing to count every word during the exam.[9]`

A solid plan ensures your response is well-structured, coherent, and directly addresses the question, preventing you from going off-topic.[13] You can write your plan directly on the question paper, as examiners will not see it.[14]
A good 5-minute plan for Task 2 involves three key steps. First, analyze the question by identifying the question type (e.g., opinion, discussion) and circling the keywords to ensure you understand exactly what is being asked.[13] Second, brainstorm 2-3 main ideas that will form your body paragraphs and think of specific examples or explanations to support each one.[14] Finally, create a simple outline, deciding the topic of each paragraph. This structure will guide your writing, improve your logical flow (Coherence and Cohesion), and help you write more quickly and confidently.[15]`

    content: `The introduction for IELTS Writing Task 1 should be a single, concise sentence that tells the examiner what the graph or chart is about. The most effective way to write this is by paraphrasing the prompt given in the question. Do not copy the prompt word-for-word, as this will not demonstrate your language skills.
There are several techniques to paraphrase effectively. One common method is to use synonyms for key words; for example, you can replace "shows" with "illustrates" or "compares," and "information" with "data." Another technique is to change the form of words, such as changing the noun "consumption" to the verb "consumed."[1][2][3] You can also change the sentence structure, for instance by switching from an active voice to a passive voice.[1][2][3] Combining two or three of these techniques will result in a strong, original introductory sentence that accurately presents the purpose of the visual data.[1][2]`

The golden rule for the overview is to never include specific data, numbers, or percentages.[6][7] Instead, you should describe the general trends. For example, you might state that "Overall, the consumption of chicken increased significantly over the period, while the figures for beef and lamb saw a steady decline." This identifies the main movements without citing the exact figures. A clear overview demonstrates to the examiner that you can identify the most significant information before analyzing it in detail in the body paragraphs.[4]`

A clear way to do this is to dedicate each body paragraph to a specific group of information. The goal is to group data based on similarities, not just by the categories given.[8]
For dynamic charts that show changes over time (like line graphs), you can group the data by trends. For instance, one paragraph could describe the items that increased, while the second paragraph focuses on those that decreased.[8][9] Another method is to divide the timeframe into logical periods and describe what happened in each.[10][11] For static charts (like pie charts or tables), you can group the largest and smallest categories in one paragraph and the remaining categories in another. By logically grouping information, you create a structured and easy-to-follow report for the examiner.[10][11]`

For downward trends, use verbs such as fall, decline, or drop. For significant drops, use plummet or plunge.[12][13][16] Corresponding nouns include a fall, a decline, a drop, a decrease.[12][13][15]
When the data goes up and down, use the verb fluctuate or the noun a fluctuation.[14][15][16] If the data stays the same, use phrases like remained stable or levelled off.[13][15] To describe the speed of change, add adverbs like dramatically, significantly, steadily, or gradually.[12][13]`

Use comparative adjectives like "higher than," "lower than," or "more popular than." For example, "The number of car sales was significantly higher than the sales of motorcycles." You can also use phrases such as "in contrast to" or "similarly" to link comparative ideas.[17] When the difference is large, use adverbs like "considerably" or "substantially." For smaller differences, use "slightly" or "marginally."[18]
Other useful structures include using "more/less/fewer" with nouns (e.g., "fewer people chose to travel by train") and superlative forms to highlight the highest or lowest points (e.g., "the most popular destination was the Pavilion").[19] Using this vocabulary demonstrates your ability to interpret and compare the data, which is crucial for a high score.[20]`

Instead of "but," use "however" or "on the other hand" to introduce a contrasting idea. Instead of "so," opt for "therefore" or "consequently" to show a result.
Another effective technique is to join sentences together using these simple conjunctions to create longer, more complex sentences rather than starting every sentence with a linking word.[6] Varying your sentence structure and avoiding the mechanical repetition of simple linkers will make your writing more dynamic and sophisticated.[2][7] The goal is to use these devices naturally to enhance clarity, not to use one in every sentence.[7][8]`

For the environment, learn terms like deforestation, carbon footprint, renewable energy, and sustainable development.[5][6] For technology, vocabulary such as artificial intelligence, digital divide, automation, and cyber security is useful.[5] When discussing health, phrases like a balanced diet, to stay in shape, and to deal with health issues are effective.[7] A good strategy is to read articles and watch talks on these common IELTS topics, noting down not just individual words but also how they are used in phrases and sentences.[7][8][9]`

    title: "How to Paraphrase Effectively Without Losing Meaning",
    tags: ["ielts", "writing", "paraphrasing", "synonyms", "sentence structure"],
    content: `Paraphrasing, or restating a sentence with the same meaning using different words, is a crucial skill for the introduction of any IELTS essay. Effective paraphrasing involves more than just swapping a few keywords for synonyms.[10] In fact, relying only on synonyms can sometimes change the original meaning, as not all synonyms are perfect substitutes in every context.[11][12]
A successful paraphrasing strategy combines several techniques. First, use synonyms for some of the original words where appropriate.[11][13] Second, change the form of words, for example, by turning a noun into a verb (e.g., "consumption" becomes "consumed").[11][13][14] Third, alter the sentence structure, for instance, by changing the word order or switching from an active to a passive voice (e.g., "developers invested money" becomes "money was invested").[13][14][15] By using a combination of these methods, you can demonstrate linguistic flexibility while ensuring the core meaning remains identical.[13]`

    title: "Avoiding Informal Language in Academic Writing",
    tags: ["ielts", "writing", "formal language", "academic tone", "vocabulary"],
    content: `Both tasks in the IELTS Academic Writing test require a formal, objective tone. Using informal language, which is more suited for speaking or casual communication, can negatively impact your score. It is crucial to avoid several common features of informal writing to maintain an appropriate academic style.
Firstly, do not use contractions; write "do not" instead of "don't" and "will not" instead of "won't."[16] Secondly, avoid slang, clichés, and overly casual phrasal verbs (e.g., use "to conduct" instead of "to carry out").[16] Thirdly, avoid vague and imprecise language like "thing" or "a lot of," opting for more specific words such as "factor" or "a significant amount."[16][17] Finally, refrain from using personal or emotional language and avoid addressing the reader directly with "you."[17][18] Instead, use a more objective and impersonal style to present your ideas.`

    title: "Using a Mix of Simple and Complex Sentences",
    tags: ["ielts", "writing", "grammar", "sentence structure", "grammatical range"],
    content: `To achieve a high score in Grammatical Range and Accuracy, you must demonstrate your ability to use a variety of sentence structures, not just one type. A high-scoring essay will contain a healthy mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences. A simple sentence has one main clause, while a complex sentence has a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses.
Relying only on simple sentences can make your writing sound childish and repetitive. Conversely, using only long, complex sentences can make your writing difficult to read and increase the chance of errors. The key is balance. Use simple sentences for clarity and emphasis, and use complex sentences to show relationships between ideas, such as cause and effect, contrast, or condition. This variety makes your writing more dynamic, sophisticated, and engaging for the examiner.`

    title: "How to Form Complex Sentences (Subordinate Clauses)",
    tags: ["ielts", "writing", "grammar", "complex sentences", "subordinate clauses"],
    content: `A complex sentence is a powerful tool for showing the relationship between ideas and is essential for a high grammar score. It is formed by combining an independent clause (a complete thought) with one or more dependent (or subordinate) clauses. These dependent clauses cannot stand alone as a sentence and are introduced by subordinating conjunctions.
Common subordinating conjunctions include 'while' and 'whereas' for contrast (e.g., "While the number of car sales rose, the figure for motorcycles fell."), 'although' for concession, and 'because' or 'since' to show a reason. By using these structures, you can connect ideas in a single sentence, demonstrating a sophisticated command of grammar. For example, instead of writing two simple sentences, you can combine them: "The government invested in public transport because traffic congestion had become a major issue."`

    tags: ["ielts", "writing task 1", "grammar", "verb tenses", "tense usage"],
    content: `The correct tense to use in Writing Task 1 depends entirely on the time frame presented in the visual data. You must analyze the dates on the chart before you start writing.
If the chart or graph shows data from a finished time in the past (e.g., from 1990 to 2010), you must use the past simple tense (e.g., "the figure increased," "sales fell"). If the data has no time reference and is a snapshot of the present (e.g., a pie chart of 'student preferences in the current year'), use the present simple tense (e.g., "the chart shows that 50% of students prefer..."). If the graph includes future predictions, use future forms like "is predicted to rise" or "is expected to reach." For process diagrams, the present simple passive is most common (e.g., "the oranges are picked and then transported").`

    title: "Using Punctuation Correctly (Commas, Semicolons)",
    tags: ["ielts", "writing", "grammar", "punctuation", "commas", "semicolons"],
    content: `Correct punctuation is a key component of grammatical accuracy. While you should use a range of punctuation, it is crucial to use it correctly. Full stops must be used to end sentences, preventing run-on sentences.
Commas are essential for clarity. Use them to separate items in a list, and after introductory phrases or clauses (e.g., "In 2005, the rate of unemployment decreased."). Commas are also used before a coordinating conjunction (like 'but' or 'and') that connects two independent clauses.
Semicolons (;) are a more advanced form of punctuation used to connect two closely related independent clauses. For example, "The sales of laptops increased steadily; conversely, desktop sales saw a sharp decline." Using a semicolon correctly can demonstrate grammatical range, but it is better to avoid it if you are not completely sure how to use it, as incorrect use will lower your score.`

    title: "Avoiding Common Grammatical Errors (Subject-Verb Agreement, Articles)",
    tags: ["ielts", "writing", "grammar", "common errors", "subject-verb agreement", "articles"],
    content: `Frequent grammatical errors can significantly lower your score, even if your ideas and vocabulary are strong. Two of the most common error areas are subject-verb agreement and the use of articles.
Subject-Verb Agreement: A singular subject needs a singular verb, and a plural subject needs a plural verb. Be careful with phrases like "The number of..." which takes a singular verb (e.g., "The number of cars is falling"), whereas "A number of..." takes a plural verb (e.g., "A number of cars are electric").
Articles (a/an/the): These small words are a frequent source of mistakes. Use 'the' for specific nouns that have already been mentioned or are unique. Use 'a/an' for general, non-specific singular countable nouns. Remember that uncountable nouns (like information, advice, traffic, knowledge) do not take 'a/an'. Always proofread your work specifically to catch these common errors.`

Overall, it is clear that urban living will increase in all countries, especially in Malaysia and the Philippines. By 2040, Malaysia will have the highest percentage of people living in cities.
In 1970, the Philippines and Malaysia had similar urban residency rates, around 31% and 30% respectively. Thailand and Indonesia had lower rates, with Thailand at 19% and Indonesia at 12%. Over the next 20 years, Malaysia’s rate went up and down, surpassing the Philippines around 40% before rapidly increasing in 1990. It is projected to reach over 80% by 2040. On the other hand, the Philippines saw a moderate decline after 1980 but is expected to recover and reach above 50% by 2040.
Indonesia has seen significant growth in urban residency, surpassing Thailand in 2000 (28%) and the Philippines in 2010 (42%). It is projected to reach 55%, the second-highest among all countries. Finally, Thailand has experienced a gradual increase and is currently around 30%. It is expected to rise to over 40% in the next 17 years.`

    content: `The bar chart provides information on five different areas of expenditure in the UK and France in 2010.
Relatively more money was spent by the UK on cars, books and cameras than France. On the former category, the UK spent just over 450,000 pounds, whereas France used about 55,000 pounds less. For books, the expenditure gap widened, but both countries expended less than they did on cars: approximately 400,000 and 300,000 pounds for the UK and France, respectively. The margin in spending was the largest for cameras, with the figure for France being more than two times smaller (150,000 pounds) than that for the UK (slightly over 350,000 pounds).
However, France’s expense on computers and perfume was higher than the UK’s. About 380,000 pounds was spent by France on computers as opposed to 350,000 pounds by the UK, but the amounts for perfume were a lot lower with the respective figures of 200,000 and just under 150,000 pounds.
Overall, the UK spent more money on cars, books and cameras, whereas France did so on the other two categories: computers and perfume. It is also apparent that both these nations used the most money on automobiles, and the biggest difference in expenditure was recorded in cameras.`

    content: `The pie charts compare the proportion of three main macronutrients in separate diets, namely an average diet, a healthy diet and a healthy diet for sport.
In general, carbohydrates are the highest nutritional ingredient overall, whereas the rate of fat is the lowest among given diets. It is noticeable that a healthy diet for sports consumes the highest amount of carbs but the lowest amount of fat compared to the two remaining diets.
Sport players select a healthy diet with 60% of carbohydrates. The percentages of carbohydrates in a healthy diet and an average diet are relatively lower, at 50% and 40% respectively. By contrast, fat consumption remains lowest in all healthy diets for people playing sports (15%), while the figures for an average diet and a healthy diet are equal (20%).
In terms of protein, average diet eaters require the highest level, at 40%. This is 10% higher than the proportion of protein in a healthy diet, and 15% more than the proportion in a healthy diet for sport.`

    content: `The given table illustrates data on different aspects of undergraduates who took six different majors at an Australian University in 2011.
Overall, while the social science departments attracted the majority of female students, there were a large number of undergraduates who preferred learning IT and engineering at university.
Specifically, most females were in favor of humanities majors (72%) and the educational sector (68%). While there were slightly more than half of this population studied Science and Physics (52% and 56%, respectively), they seemed less appealing to technological majors such as information technology and engineering which accounted for roughly 15%.
It is also clear that the proportion of non-native English speakers and overseas undergraduates took the leading position in science and technology majors. In particular, approximately half of students whose first language was not English enrolled in the IT department, which was followed by science (45%) and engineering (42%) majors. Whereas the physics department experienced 38% of enrolment of this group, humanities and pedagogy attracted nearly 15% of undergraduates.
The same pattern can be observed in the percentage of students born in other foreign countries. The physics and IT departments had the highest percentage of enrolment (56%), and engineering held second place with 48%. Other departments were listed in decreasing order as follows: science, education, and humanities, with 20%, 23%, and 31% respectively.`

Looking at the first and second stages of the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analyzing it. Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analyzed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.
At the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.`

    content: `The diagram illustrates the production of power through the use of a hydroelectric dam.
The process begins with water in a reservoir and ends with the transmission of power via long-distance power lines.
In order to generate hydroelectricity, the first step is to collect water in a reservoir. When power generations begins the water passes through an intake in the bottom of the dam and then enters a long tunnel called a penstock. On the other hand, when power is not being produced the intake is blocked by a large gate that prevents the flow of water. However, when the intake is opened, the water flows down the penstock and the pressure it creates is used to spin a turbine, which is connected to a generator in a place referred to as the powerhouse. At the same time, the water that has gone through the turbine flows out into the river below the dam. Finally, the generator in the powerhouse is connected to power lines which are used to transport the electricity over long distances.`
